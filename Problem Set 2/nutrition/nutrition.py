"""
The U.S. Food & Drug Adminstration (FDA) offers downloadable/printable
posters that "show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed
raw fruits â€¦ in the United States. Retail stores are welcome to download the
posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close
proximity to the relevant foods in the stores."

In a file called nutrition.py, implement a program that prompts consumers
users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of
calories in one portion of that fruit, per the FDA's poster for fruits, which
is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users will input
fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., strawberries, not strawberry).
Ignore any input that isn't a fruit.
